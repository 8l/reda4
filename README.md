:r4 is a Computer Programming Language.
This lang born in 2005 when I study ColorForth for learn.

This version is a bytecode interpreter for WINE, WINCE and ANDROID platform.

* forth-like language to program computers.
* uses prefixes to guide compiler behavior, like Colorforth but without colors..a colorless colorforth.
* has a VM, editor, games, programming samples.
* has a compiler for FASM asembler, can make .exe

- Only can generate win exec, waiting for a smart coder for lin,mac etc.
